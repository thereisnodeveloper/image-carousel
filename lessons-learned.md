#### Managing Workspace/Git
- have CSS reset by default
#### JavaScript
- let images (and other elements) load before trying to measure/get information from them. Use `onload`


- it does not matter whether an element reference is added to an array before or
  after appending it to its parent in the DOM. Both approaches yield the same
  result in terms of functionality and performance.

- `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', findLargest);`
